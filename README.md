# Chatter

## Overview

Ever wanted a live group chat for the class you are enrolled? Well now there is Chatter. A live chat web application that connects individuals within a class to a chat room. It is like Slacks but for class. Students will enroll in the app and be able to live chat in groups or private chat with someone. There will be multiple session rooms available, allowing for multiple chat sessions at once. Students will also be able to see who is online at the moment in their class. Chatter will require a key to login; this is provided by the instructor (key is generated by Chatter).

## Data Model

The application will store Users, Chat Room, and Private Message

* Users can be in multiple Chat Rooms (By reference).
* Users can be in multiple Private Messages (By reference).
* Every Chatroom will contain a list of username (By Reference).
* Every Private Message will contain 2 username (By Reference).

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: String,
  password: String, //Hashed Password,
  chatrooms: [ Number ], //Chat Room IDs
  email: String,
  permission: Number //User's permission level
}
```

An Example Chat Room

```javascript
{
  name: String, //Chat Room name
  id: Number, //Chat Room ID
  users: [ String ] //Array of usernames
  messages: [
    {
    username: String, //User's username
    message: String, //User's message
    time: String //Time that the message was sent
    }
  ]
}
```

An Example Private Message

```javascript
{
  users: [ String ] //Array of usernames
  messages: [
    {
    username: String, //User's username
    message: String, //User's message
    time: Date //Time that the message was sent
    }
  ]
}
```

```javascript
{
  key: String, //An unhashed key used for login
  type: String //Type of key. Either login or the chatroom ID
}
```

## Wireframes

(___TODO__: wireframes for all of the pages on your site; they can be as simple as photos of drawings or you can use a tool like Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, etc._)

/list/create - page for creating a new shopping list

![list create](documentation/list-create.png)

/list - page for showing all shopping lists

![list](documentation/list.png)

/list/slug - page for showing specific shopping list

![list](documentation/list-slug.png)

## Site map

(___TODO__: draw out a site map that shows how pages are related to each other_)

Here's a [complex example from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Sitemap_google.jpg), but you can create one without the screenshots, drop shadows, etc. ... just names of pages and where they flow to.

## User Stories or Use Cases

1. As a non-registered user, I can register a new account with the site.
2. As an user, I can log in to the site.
3. As an user, I can send/view messages to rooms I have access to.
4. As an user, I can send/view direct messages to other users.
6. As an administrator, I can create keys for users to gain access to rooms.
7. As an administrator, I can kick users out of rooms.
8. As an administrator, I can create/delete chatrooms.

## Research Topics

(___TODO__: the research topics that you're planning on working on along with their point values... and the total points of research topics listed_)

* (5 points) Integrate user authentication
    * I'm going to be using passport for user authentication
    * And account has been made for testing; I'll email you the password
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/register</code> for register page
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/login</code> for login page
* (4 points) Perform client side form validation using a JavaScript library
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/my-form</code>
    * if you put in a number that's greater than 5, an error message will appear in the dom
* (5 points) vue.js
    * used vue.js as the frontend framework; it's a challenging library to learn, so I've assigned it 5 points

10 points total out of 8 required points (___TODO__: addtional points will __not__ count for extra credit_)
