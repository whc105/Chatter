# Chatter

## Overview

Ever wanted a live group chat for the class you are enrolled? Well now there is Chatter. A live chat web application that connects individuals within a class to a chat room. It is like Slacks but for class. Students will enroll in the app and be able to live chat in groups or private chat with someone. There will be multiple session rooms available, allowing for multiple chat sessions at once. Students will also be able to see who is online at the moment in their class. Chatter will require a key to login; this is provided by the instructor (key is generated by Chatter).

## Data Model

The application will store Users, Chat Room, and Private Message

* Users can be in multiple Chat Rooms (By reference).
* Users can be in multiple Private Messages (By reference).
* Every Chatroom will contain a list of username (By Reference).
* Every Private Message will contain 2 username (By Reference).

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: String,
  password: String, //Hashed Password,
  chatrooms: [ Number ], //Chat Room IDs
  email: String,
  permission: Number //User's permission level
}
```

An Example Chat Room

```javascript
{
  name: String, //Chat Room name
  id: Number, //Chat Room ID
  users: [ String ] //Array of usernames
  messages: [
    {
    username: String, //User's username
    message: String, //User's message
    time: String //Time that the message was sent
    }
  ]
}
```

An Example Private Message

```javascript
{
  users: [ String ] //Array of usernames
  messages: [
    {
    username: String, //User's username
    message: String, //User's message
    time: Date //Time that the message was sent
    }
  ]
}
```

```javascript
{
  key: String, //An unhashed key used for login
  type: String, //Type of key. Either login or the chatroom ID
  uses: Number //Number of uses for the key
}
```

## User Stories or Use Cases

1. As a non-registered user, I can register a new account with the site.
2. As an user, I can log in to the site.
3. As an user, I can send/view messages to rooms I have access to.
4. As an user, I can send/view direct messages to other users.
6. As an administrator, I can create keys for users to gain access to rooms.
7. As an administrator, I can kick users out of rooms.
8. As an administrator, I can create/delete chatrooms.

## Research Topics

* (2 points) Bootstrap 4
    * Bootstrap is a CSS Framework that will help speed up the front-end design building process.
    * I am using Bootstrap because it has several components already designed so I do not have to build them myself.
    * I will also be using addons to the default Bootstrap 4 to further customize my app.
    * This will help with the general design of my web app.
    * I give it 2 points because it is a popular CSS Framework. Also, I will include some configurations to it.
* (5 points) ReactJS
    * React JS is a front-end Javascript framework that allows web components to be seperated from the webpage.
    * I am using React because I want the ability to reuse components and modify them without worrying about breaking the page.
    * I give it 4 points because it is a popular front-end framework that is moderately difficult to pick up.
* (4 Points) Passport JS User Authentication
    * Passport JS is an user authentication middleware. It can authenticate users locally or through a service like Facebook or Google.
    * I will be using passport JS to locally authenticate users.
    * I will also be using passport JS to authenticate users via Google Login (instead of local login).
    * I give it 4 points because I will be using local authentication along with Google.
* (4 Points) Socket IO
    * Socket IO is a real-time library. It will enable server side responses.
    * I will use Socket IO for the live chat system.
    * I will give it 4 points because it seems like a moderately tough system to implement.
      * Furthermore, I think I need to move my database to MLab and include a live demo chat system (with Bots that say lorem ipsums).

15 points total out of 8 required points.
